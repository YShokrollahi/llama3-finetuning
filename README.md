How to Fine-Tune LLaMA 3 with LoRA in H100 GPUs or A100 or A100 40GB

To fine-tune LLaMA 3 using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), follow these steps:

    Set Up Environment:
        Ensure you have a Python environment with the necessary dependencies. Install the required libraries such as transformers, datasets, and peft.

    Prepare Dataset:
        Load and preprocess the dataset you intend to use for fine-tuning. You can use the datasets library to load datasets like Common Crawl, C4, or your custom data.

    Load Pre-trained LLaMA 3 Model:
        Use the transformers library to load the pre-trained LLaMA 3 model and tokenizer. This will be the base model that you will fine-tune.

    Implement LoRA:
        Apply LoRA to the LLaMA 3 model to reduce the number of trainable parameters. This involves adding low-rank matrices to the attention layers, which allows for efficient fine-tuning.

    Fine-Tuning:
        Set up the training loop using your preferred deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch).
        During training, only the LoRA parameters are updated, while the pre-trained weights of the LLaMA 3 model remain frozen.

    Training Configuration:
        Configure the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
        Use a suitable optimizer and learning rate scheduler for fine-tuning.

    Evaluation:
        After fine-tuning, evaluate the performance of your model on a validation or test set to ensure it has learned effectively.

    Save and Deploy:
        Once satisfied with the performance, save the fine-tuned model and deploy it for your use case.
